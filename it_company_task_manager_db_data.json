The goal is to streamline how we build, test, and deploy code changes. You'll need to configure the pipeline to run automated tests after each commit and ensure deployments are smooth and error-free. Pay attention to the integration points between various tools and services. We need to make sure that the entire process is robust and scalable. Regular monitoring of the pipeline will be key to catching issues early on.",

You’ll need to gather data on system load, response times, and any potential bottlenecks. Regular monitoring will help us ensure that the system is running optimally. Should any issues arise, you’ll be responsible for identifying the root cause and coordinating with the team to implement fixes.
